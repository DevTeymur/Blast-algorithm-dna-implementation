# Blast-algorithm-dna-implementation

In bioinformatics, BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) is an algorithm and program for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotides of DNA and/or RNA sequences.

The provided code implements the Blast algorithm on the DNA sequence taken from the text file.

## Compile and run
After compiling the code successfully, a user can run the program.
#### Possible scenarios
1 . One possible way to run the program is to provide the name of the file in which the sequence is stored. A pattern is also required to search it inside the sequence.
2. In the second case a user can only input the name of the text file. After, the code will request the pattern to be input.

--help command is also available with a little information inside showing how to run the code.
